For the initial interferometric detectors, a noise floor in strain
close to 2~\texttimes~10\super{-23}~\Hz was achieved. Detecting a
strain in space at this level implies measuring a residual motion of
each of the test masses of about 8~\texttimes~10\super{-20}~m/\Hz over
part of the operating range of the detector, which may be from
$\simeq$~10~Hz to a few kHz. Advanced detectors will push this
target down further by another factor of 10\,--\,15. This sets a
formidable goal for the optical detection system at the output of the
interferometer.
