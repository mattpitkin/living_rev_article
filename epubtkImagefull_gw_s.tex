We recommend a number of excellent books for reference. For a popular account of
the development of the gravitational-wave field the reader should consult
Chapter~10 of \textit{Black Holes and Time Warps} by Kip S.\ Thorne~\cite{Thorne}, or
the more recent books, \textit{Einstein's Unfinished Symphony}, by Marcia
Bartusiak~\cite{Bartusiak:2000} and \textit{Gravity from the Ground Up}, by Bernard
Schutz~\cite{Schutz:2003}. A comprehensive review of developments toward laser
interferometer detectors is found in \textit{Fundamentals of Interferometric
Gravitational Wave Detectors} by Peter Saulson~\cite{Saulsonbook}, and
discussions relevant to the technology of both bar and interferometric detectors
are found in \textit{The Detection of Gravitational Waves} edited by David
Blair~\cite{Blair}.


In addition to the wealth of articles that can be found on the home site of
this journal, there are also various informative websites that can easily be
found, including the homepages of the various international collaborative
projects searching for gravitational waves, such as the LIGO Scientific
Collaboration~\cite{LSCweb}.
