The sensitivity of various gravitational-wave detection
    techniques across 13 orders of magnitude in frequency. At the low
    frequency end the sensitivity curves for pulsar timing arrays
    (based on current observations and future observations with the
    Square Kilometre Array~\cite{SKA}) are extrapolated from Figure~4
    in~\cite{Yardley:2010}. In the mid-range LISA, DECIGO and BBO are
    described in more detail in Section~\ref{section:space}, with the
    DECIGO and BBO sensitivity curves taken from models given in
    \cite{Yagi:2011}. At the high frequency the sensitivities are
    represented by three generations of laser interferometers: LIGO,
    Advanced LIGO and the Einstein Telescope (see
    Sections~\ref{section:construction}, \ref{subsection:aligo} and
    \ref{subsec:et}). Also included is a representative sensitivity
    for the AURIGA~\cite{AURIGA}, Allegro~\cite{Mauceli:1996} and
    Nautilus~\cite{NAUTILUS} bar detectors.
