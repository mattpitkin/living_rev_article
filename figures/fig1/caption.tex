\label{fig:fullspectrum}
The sensitivities (given as amplitude spectral densities) of various current and future gravitational-wave detectors
    across $\sim14$ orders of magnitude in frequency. At the low
    frequency end there are estimated sensitivity curves for the current International Pulsar Timing Array and future observations with the
    Square Kilometre Array~\cite{SKA}. In the mid-range are the future space-based detectors LISA, DECIGO and BBO, which are
    described in more detail in Section~\ref{section:space}. At the high frequency the sensitivities are
    represented by three generations of laser interferometers: initial LIGO,
    Advanced LIGO and the Einstein Telescope (see
    Sections~\ref{section:construction}, \ref{subsection:aligo} and
    \ref{subsec:et}). Also shown are a range of potential sources for the detectors, including the gravitational wave signal from GW150914 \cite{GW150914}. This image was created using the GWplotter tool \cite{GWplotter} and a full description of the detector curves used and sources esimates can be found in \cite{2015CQGra..32a5014M}.
