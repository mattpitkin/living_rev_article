A design sensitivity amplitude spectral density curve for LISA
created using the standard parameters in the online generator
at~\cite{lisasens}. The curve assumes equal length arms, sensitivity
averaged over the whole sky and all polarisations, and an SNR of
1. Also included is a curve showing the expected background noise from
galactic white-dwarf--binary systems, which will dominate over the
instrumental noise in the range from $\approx$~0.1\,--\,1~mHz.
