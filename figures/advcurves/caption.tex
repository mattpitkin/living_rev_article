Design sensitivity curves for the Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo
and KAGRA second-generation detectors, and the observed sensitivity~\cite{O1curve} of the Hanford interferometer for Advanvced LIGO's first observing run (O1).
The Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo curves come from
\cite{lrr-2016-1}, and the KAGRA curve comes from equation 5 of~\cite{2012arXiv1202.4031M}. These curves are based on specific
configurations of the detectors and are therefore subject to change.
