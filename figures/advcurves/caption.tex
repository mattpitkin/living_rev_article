Design sensitivity curves for the Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo
and LCGT second-generation detectors. The Advanced LIGO curve comes from
\cite{Harry:2010}, the Advanced Virgo curve comes
from~\cite{AdvVirgoweb}, and the LCGT curve comes
from~\cite{Arai:2009}. These curves are based on specific
configurations of the detectors and are therefore subject to change.
