%For the update the author list has changed to be Matthew Pitkin,
%Stuart Reid, Sheila Rowan and Jim Hough. There have been minor updates
%to Sections \ref{section:introduction}, \ref{section:gravwaves} and
%\ref{section:Detection}; major updates to Sections~\ref{section:noise}
%and \ref{section:interferometry}; Section~\ref{section:construction}
%has been renamed and includes entirely new material on the operation
%of, and results from, the first generation of gravitational wave
%detectors and upgrades that are under way; and
%Section~\ref{section:space} also includes major updates about the
%status of LISA. The number of references has increased from 110 to 324.}
