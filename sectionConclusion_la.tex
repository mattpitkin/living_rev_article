\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion} 

Significant effort worldwide has been invested, and is continuing to be
invested, in the development of both ground and spaced based gravitational-wave
detectors. Over the coming years, ground-based detectors will reach
sensitivities that will enable the direct observation of gravitational waves as
predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and open the exciting new
field of gravitational-wave astronomy. Studying the gravitational-wave
sky could radically change our understanding of the Universe, expanding our
knowledge of fundamental physics, cosmology and relativistic astrophysics.
Gravitational-wave observations will allow us to gaze into the heart of the most
violent events in the Universe, and will help answer some of the biggest
questions, particularly in cosmology when combined with other astronomical
observations.
