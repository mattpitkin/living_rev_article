\section{Laser Interferometric Techniques for Gravitational-Wave Detectors}
\label{section:interferometry} 

As explained in Section~\ref{subsubsection:shotnoise}, high-power laser
light is needed to overcome limitations of a detector's sensitivity due to
photoelectron shot noise. The situation can be helped greatly if a multi-pass
arrangement is used in the arms of the interferometer as this multiplies up the
apparent movement by the number of bounces the light makes in the arms. The
multiple beams can either be separate, as in an optical delay line~\cite{Weiss,
Billing}, or may lie on top of each other as in a Fabry--P\'{e}rot resonant
cavity~\cite{Drever2}, as shown in Figure~\ref{figure:Michelsons}.
