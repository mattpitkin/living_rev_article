\section{Operation of First-Generation Long-Baseline Detectors}
\label{section:construction} 

Prior to the start of the 21st century there existed several prototype
laser interferometric detectors, constructed by various research groups around
the world -- at the Max-Planck-Instit\"ut f\"ur Quantenoptik in
Garching~\cite{Shoemaker}, at the University of Glasgow~\cite{Robertson}, at the
California Institute of Technology~\cite{Abramovici}, at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology~\cite{Fritschel2}, at the Institute of Space and
Astronautical Science in Tokyo~\cite{Mizuno} and at the astronomical observatory
in Tokyo~\cite{Araya}. These detectors had arm lengths varying from 10~m to
100~m and had either multibeam delay lines or resonant Fabry--P\'{e}rot cavities in
their arms. The 10~m detector that used to exist at Glasgow is shown in
Figure~\ref{figure:Glasgowprototype}. The sensitivities of some of these detectors reached a level -- better than
10\super{-18} for millisecond bursts -- such that the technology could be
considered sufficiently mature to propose the construction of detectors of much
longer baseline that would be capable of reaching the performance required to
have a real possibility of detecting gravitational waves.  By the early 2000s an international
network of such long baseline gravitational wave detectors was constructed and commissioned,
and science-quality data from these has been analysed since 2002 (see Section~\ref{subsection:runs} and
Section~\ref{subsection:results} for a review of their science data runs and results).

The American LIGO project~\cite{LIGOweb} comprises two detector systems with
arms of 4~km length, one in Hanford, Washington, and one in Livingston,
Louisiana (also known as the LIGO Hanford Observatory 4k [LHO~4k] and LIGO
Livingston Observatory 4k [LLO~4k], or H1 and L1, respectively). One half length,
2~km, interferometer was also contained inside the same evacuated enclosure at
Hanford (also known as the LHO~2k, or H2). The design goal of the 4~km
interferometers was to have a peak strain sensitivity between 100\,--\,200~Hz of
$\sim$~3~\texttimes~10\super{-23}~\Hz~\cite{LIGOSRD} (see
Figure~\ref{figure:LIGOstrains}), which was achieved during the fifth science run
(Section~\ref{subsection:runs}). A birds-eye view of the Hanford site showing the
central building and the directions of the two arms is shown in
Figure~\ref{figure:LIGOsite}. In October 2010 the LIGO detectors shut down and
decommissioning began in preparation for the installation of a more sensitive
instrument known as Advanced LIGO (see Section~\ref{subsection:aligo}).
The French/Italian Virgo project~\cite{VIRGOweb} comprises a single
3~km arm-length detector at Cascina near Pisa. As mentioned earlier,
it is designed to have better performance than the other detectors,
down to 10~Hz.

The TAMA300 detector~\cite{TAMAweb}, which has arms of length 300~m, at the
Tokyo Astronomical Observatory was the first of the ``beyond-prototype''
detectors to become operational. This detector is built mainly underground and
partly has the aim of adding to the gravitational-wave detector network for
sensitivity to events within the local group of galaxies, but is primarily a
test bed for developing techniques for future larger-scale detectors. Initial
operation of the interferometer was achieved in 1999 and power recycling was
implemented for data taking in 2003~\cite{Arai:2003}.

All the systems mentioned above are designed to use resonant cavities in the
arms of the detectors and use standard wire-sling techniques for suspending the
test masses. The German/British detector, GEO600~\cite{GEOweb}, built near
Hannover, Germany, is somewhat different. It makes use of a four-pass delay-line
system with advanced optical signal-enhancement techniques, utilises very-low
loss-fused silica suspensions for the test masses, and, despite its smaller size,
was designed to have a sensitivity at frequencies above a few hundred Hz
comparable to the first phases of Virgo and LIGO during their initial operation.
It uses both power recycling (Section~\ref{subsection:powerrec}) and tunable signal
recycling (Section~\ref{subsection:sigrec}), often referred to together as dual
recycling.


To gain the most out of the detectors as a true network, data sharing and joint
analyses are required. In the summer of 2001 the LIGO and GEO600 teams signed a
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), under the auspices of the LIGO Scientific
Collaboration (LSC)~\cite{LSCweb}, allowing complete data sharing between the
two groups. Part of this agreement has been to ensure that both LIGO and
GEO600 have taken data in coincidence (see below). Coincident data taking, and
joint analysis, has also occurred between the TAMA300 project and the LSC
detectors. The Virgo collaboration also signed an MoU with the LSC, which has
allowed data sharing since May 2006.


The operation and commissioning of these detectors is a continually-evolving
process, and the current state of this review only covers developments until
late-2010. For the most up-to-date information on detectors readers are advised
to consult the proceedings of the Amaldi meetings, GWDAW/GWPAW (Gravitational
Wave Data Analysis Workshops), and GWADW (Gravitational Wave Advanced Detectors
Workshops) -- see~\cite{confs} for a list of past conferences.


For the first and second generations of detector, much effort has gone into
estimating the expected number of sources that might be observable given their
design sensitivities. In particular, for what are thought to be the strongest
sources: the coalescence of neutron-star binaries or black holes (see
Section~\ref{sec:cbc} for current rates as constrained by observations). These
estimates, based on observation and simulation, are summarised in
Table~5 of~\cite{Abadie:2010e} and the \textit{realistic} rates
suggest initial detectors would expect to see 0.02, 0.004 and 0.007
events per year for neutron-star--binary, black-hole--neutron-star, and
black-hole--binary systems, respectively (it should be noted that there
is a range of possible rates consistent with current observations and
models)\epubtkFootnote{In terms of event rates the current best estimates
for neutron-star--binary merger rates, based on the known population
of neutron-star--binary systems, gives a 95\% confidence interval
between 1\,--\,1000~\texttimes~10\super{-6} per year per Milky Way
Equivalent Galaxy (MWEG), where MWEG is equivalent to a volume that
contains a blue light luminosity with $L = 9\times10^9\,L_{\odot}$
(MWEG was used in the S1 and S2 LIGO search, but was then changed to
the $L_{10}$ unit, where $L_{10}$ is given as 10\super{10} times the
blue-light luminosity of the sun, although there is only a 10\%
difference between the two),~\cite{Abadie:2010e, Kalogera:2004a,
Kalogera:2004b}, with a peak in the distribution at
100~\texttimes~10\super{-6} per year per MWEG -- or $\approx$~0.02 per year
for initial LIGO at design sensitivity. The expected rate of black-hole binary systems, or black-hole--neutron-star systems is far harder
to infer as none have been observed, but estimates can be made on
the population for a wide variety of models and give a 95\%
confidence range of 0.05\,--\,100~\texttimes~10\super{-6} per year per
MWEG and 0.01\,--\,30~\texttimes~10\super{-6} per year per MWEG
respectively~\cite{Abadie:2010e, OShaughnessy:2005,
OShaughnessy:2008, Abbott:2008a}. As an example of how to convert
from rates to event numbers, cumulative blue-light luminosities with
respect to distance from the Earth in Mpcs, and the horizon
distances of the LIGO detectors from S2 through to S4, can be seen
in Figure~3 of~\cite{Abbott:2008a}.}. Second generation detectors
(see Section~\ref{subsection:aligo}), which can observe approximately
1000 time more volume than the initial detectors might, expect to see
40, 10, and 20 per year for the same sources. With such rates a great
deal of astrophysics could be possible (see~\cite{Sathyaprakash:2009}
for examples).


\subsection{Science runs}
\label{subsection:runs} 

Over the last decade the commissioning and improvement of the various
gravitational-wave detectors has been suspended at various stages to take data
for astrophysical analysis. These have been times when it was considered that
the detectors were sensitive and stable enough (or had made sufficient
improvements over earlier states) to make astrophysical searches worthwhile.
Within the LSC these have been called the \textit{Science} (S) runs, for Virgo they
have been the \textit{Virgo Science Runs} (VSR), and for TAMA300 they have been
the \textit{Data Taking} (DT) periods. A time-line of science runs for the various
interferometric detectors, can be seen in Figure~\ref{figure:runtimes}.A figure of merit for the sensitivity of a detector is to calculate
its \textit{horizon distance}. This is the maximum range out to which
it could see the coalescence of two $1.4\,M_{\odot}$ neutron stars
that are optimally oriented and located (i.e., with the orbital plane
perpendicular to the line-of-sight, and with this plane parallel to
the detector plane, so that the antenna response is at its maximum) at
a signal-to-noise ratio of 8~\cite{Abbott:2005b}. The horizon distance
can be converted to a range that is an average over all sky locations
and source orientations (i.e.\, not the best case scenario) by dividing
it by 2.26~\cite{Sutton:2003}) -- we shall use this angle averaged
range throughout the rest of this review.

\subsubsection{TAMA300}


The first interferometric detector to start regular data taking with sufficient
sensitivity and stability to enable it to potentially detect gravitational waves
from the the galactic centre was TAMA300~\cite{Ando:2001}. Over the period
between August 1999 to January 2004 TAMA had nine data-taking periods
(denominated DT1--9) over which time its typical strain noise sensitivity, in
its most sensitive frequency band improved from
$\sim$~3~\texttimes~10\super{-19}~\Hz to
$\sim$~1.5~\texttimes~10\super{-21}~\Hz~\cite{Akutsu:2006}. TAMA300
operated in coincidence with the LIGO and GEO600 detectors for two of
the science data-taking periods. More recently focus has shifted to
the Cryogenic Laser Interferometer Observatory (CLIO) prototype
detector~\cite{Yamamoto:2008, CLIOweb}, designed to test technologies
for a future \textit{second-generation} Japanese detector called the
Large-scale Cryogenic Gravitational-Wave Telescope (LCGT) (see
Section~\ref{subsection:aligo}).


\subsubsection{LIGO}
\label{sec:ligoruns} 

The first LIGO detector to achieve lock (meaning having the interferometer
stably held on a dark fringe of the interference pattern, with light resonating
throughout the cavity) was H2 in late 2000. By early 2002 all three detectors
had achieved lock and have since undergone many periods of commissioning and
science data taking. Over the period from mid-2001 to mid-2002 the
commissioning process improved the detectors' peak sensitivities by several
orders of magnitude, with L1 going from
$\sim$~10\super{-17}\,--\,10\super{-20}~\Hz at 150~Hz. In summer 2002
it was decided that the detectors were at a sensitivity, and had a
good enough lock stability, to allow a science data-taking run. This
was potentially sensitive to local galactic burst events. From 23
August to 9 September 2002 the three LIGO detectors, along with GEO600
(and, for some time, TAMA300), undertook their first coincident
science run, denoted S1 (see~\cite{Abbott:2004a} for the state of the
LIGO and GEO600 detectors at the time of S1). At this time the most
sensitive detector was L1 with a peak sensitivity at around 300~Hz of
2\,--\,3~\texttimes~10\super{-21}~\Hz. The best strain
amplitude sensitivity curve for S1 (and the subsequent LIGO science runs) can be seen in
Figure~\ref{figure:LIGOstrains}. The amount of time over the run that
the detectors were said to be in science mode, i.e., stable and with
the interferometer locked, called their duty cycle, or duty factor,
was 42\% for L1, 58\% for H1 and 73\% for H2. For the most sensitive
detector, L1, the inspiral range was typically 0.08~Mpc.For the second science run (S2), from 14 February to 14 April 2003, the noise
floor was considerably improved over S1 by several upgrades including: improving
and stabilising the optical levers used to measure the mirror orientation to
reduce the low frequency ($\lesssim$~50~Hz) noise; replacing the coil drivers
that are used as actuators to control the position and orientation of suspended
mirrors, to improve the mid-frequency ($\sim$~50\,--\,200~Hz) noise floor; and
increasing the laser power in the interferometer to reduce shot noise and
improve the high frequency ($\gtrsim$~200~Hz) sensitivity (see
Section~IIA of~\cite{Abbott:2005a} for a more thorough description of
the detector improvements made for S2). These changes improved the
sensitivities by about an order of magnitude across the frequency band
with a best strain, for L1, of $\sim$~3~\texttimes~10\super{-22}~\Hz
between 200\,--\,300~Hz. The duty factor during S2 was 74\% for H1,
58\% for H2 and 38\% for L1, with a triple coincidence time when all
three detectors were in lock of 22\% of the run. The average inspiral
ranges during the run were approximately 0.9, 0.4 and 0.3~Mpc for L1,
H1 and H2 respectively. This run was also operated in coincidence with
the TAMA300 DT8 run. 


For the the third science run (S3), from 31 October 2003 to 9 January 2004,
the detectors were again improved, with the majority of sensitivity increase in
the mid-frequency range. This run was also operated partially in coincidence
with GEO600. The best sensitivity, which was for H1, was
$\sim$~5~\texttimes~10\super{-23}~\Hz between 100\,--\,200~Hz. The duty factors
were 69\% for H1, 63\% for H2 and only 22\% for L1, with a 16\% triple
coincidence time. L1's poor duty factor was due to large levels of anthropogenic
seismic noise near the site during the day.


The fourth science run (S4), from 22 February to 23 March 2005, saw less-drastic
improvements in detector sensitivity across a wide frequency band, but did make
large improvements for frequencies $\lesssim$~70~Hz. Between S3 and S4 a better
seismic isolation system, which actively measured and countered for ground
motion, was installed in L1, greatly reducing the amount of time it was thrown
out of lock. For H1 the laser power was able to be increased to its full design
power of 10~W~\cite{Abbott:2007b}. The duty factors were 80\% for H1, 81\% for
H2 and 74\% for L1, with a 56\% triple coincidence time. The most sensitive
detector, H1, had an inspiral range of 7.1~Mpc.


By mid-to-late 2005 the detectors had equaled their design sensitivities over
most of the frequency band and were also maintaining good stability and high
duty factors. It was decided to perform a long science run with the aim of
collecting one year's worth of triple coincident data, with an angle-averaged
inspiral range of equal to, or greater than, 10~Mpc for L1 and H1, and 5~Mpc
or better for H2. This run, S5, spanned from 4 November 2005 (L1 started
slightly later on 14 November) until 1 October 2007, and the performance of the
detectors during it is summarised in~\cite{LIGOS5}. One year of triple
coincidence was achieved on 21 September 2007, with a total triple coincidence
duty factor of 52.5\% for the whole run. The average insprial range over S5
was $\sim$~15~Mpc for H1 and L1, and $\sim$~8~Mpc for H2.


After the end of S5 the LIGO H2 detector and GEO600 were kept operational while
possible in an evening and weekend mode called Astrowatch. This observing mode
continued until early 2009, after which H2 was retired. During this time
commissioning of some upgrades to the 4~km LIGO detectors took place for the
sixth and final initial LIGO science run (S6) -- some of which are
summarised in~\cite{Whitcomb:2008}. The aim of these upgrades, called
Enhanced LIGO~\cite{EnhancedLIGO}, was to try and  increase
sensitivity by a factor of two. Enhanced LIGO involved the direct
implementation of technologies and techniques designed for the later
upgrade to Advanced LIGO (see Section~\ref{subsection:aligo}) such as,
most notably, higher-powered lasers, a DC readout scheme (see
Section~\ref{sec:readout}), the addition of output mode cleaners and
the movement of some hardware into the vacuum system. The lasers,
supplied by the Albert Einstein Institute and manufactured by Laser
Zentrum Hannover, give a maximum power of $\approx$~30~W, which is
around 3 times the initial LIGO power. The upgrade to higher power
required that several of the optical components needed to be
replaced. These upgrades were only carried out on the 4~km H1 and L1
detectors due to the H2 detector being left in Astrowatch mode during
the commissioning period. The upgrades were able to produce 1.5\,--\,2
times sensitivity increases at frequencies above $\approx$~200~Hz, but
generally at lower frequencies various sources of noise meant
sensitivity increases were not possible. S6 took place from July 2009
until 20 October 2010, at which point decommissioning started for the
full upgrade to Advanced LIGO. Typically the detectors ran with laser
power at $\approx$~10~W during the day (at higher power the detector
was less stable and the higher level of anthropogenic noise during the
day meant that achieving and maintaining lock required lower power)
and $\approx$~20~W at night, leading to inspiral ranges from
$\approx$~10\,--\,20~Mpc.


\subsubsection{GEO600}


GEO600 achieved first lock as a power-recycled Michelson (with no signal
recycling) in late 2001. Commissioning over the following year,
detailed in~\cite{Hewitson:2003}, included increases in the laser
power, installation of monolithic suspensions for the end test masses
(although not for the beam splitter and inboard mirrors),
rearrangement of the optical bench to reduce scattered light and
implementation of an automatic alignment system. For the S1 run,
carried out in coincidence with LIGO (and, in part, TAMA300), the
detector was kept in this configuration (see~\cite{Abbott:2004a} for
the status of the detector during S1). It had a very high duty factor
of $\sim$~98\%, although its strain sensitivity was $\sim$~2 orders of
magnitude lower than the LIGO instruments. The auto-alignment system
in GEO600 has since meant that it has been able to operate for long
periods without manual intervention to regain lock, as has been the
case for initial LIGO.Following S1 the signal recycling mirror was installed and in late 2003 the
first lock of the fully dual-recycled system was achieved
(see~\cite{Smith:2004, Willke:2004, Grote:2005} for information on the
commissioning of GEO600 as a dual-recycled detector). Other upgrades included the
installation of the final mirrors, suspended as triple pendulums, and with
monolithic final stages. Once installed it was found that there was a radius of
curvature mismatch with one of the mirrors, which had to be compensated for by
carefully heating the mirror. Due to this commissioning effort GEO600 did not
participate in the S2 run. Very soon after the implementation of dual-recycling
GEO600 took part in the S3 run. This occurred over two time intervals from
5\,--\,11 November 2003, dubbed S3I, and from 30 December 2003 to 13 January 2004,
dubbed S3II. During S3I GEO600 operated with the signal-recycling cavity tuned
to $\sim$~1.3~kHz, and had a $\sim$~95\% duty factor, but was then taken
off-line for more commissioning work. In the period between S3I and II various
sources of noise and lock loss were diagnosed and mitigated, including noise
from a servo in the signal recycling cavity and electronic noise on a
photo-diode~\cite{Smith:2004}. This lead to improved sensitivity by up to an
order of magnitude at some frequencies (see Figure~\ref{figure:GEOstrains}). For
S3II the signal recycling cavity was tuned to 1~kHz and, due to the upgrades,
had an increased duty factor of $\sim$~99\%. GEO600 operated during the whole of
S4 (22 February to 24 March 2004), in coincidence with LIGO, with a $\sim$~97\%
duty factor. It used the same optical configuration as S3, but had sensitivity
improvements from a few times to up to an order of magnitude over the S3
values~\cite{Hild:2006a}.


The main changes to the detector after S4 were to shift the resonance condition
of the signal recycling cavity to a lower frequency, 350~Hz, allowing better
sensitivity in the few hundred Hz regime, and increasing the circulating laser
power, with an input power of 10~W. The pre-S5 peak sensitivity was
$\sim$~4~\texttimes~10\super{-22}~\Hz at around 400~Hz, with an inspiral
range of 0.6\,Mpc~\cite{Hild:2006b}. GEO600 did not join S5 at the start of the
LIGO run, but from 21 January 2006 was in a night-and-weekend data-taking mode
whilst noise hunting studies and commissioning were conducted. For S5 the signal
recycling cavity was re-tuned up to 550~Hz. It went into full-time data taking
from 1 May to 16 October 2006, with an instrumental duty factor of 94\%. The
average peak sensitivity during S5 was better than
3~\texttimes~10\super{-22}~\Hz (see~\cite{Willke:2007} for a
summary of GEO600 during S5). After this it was deemed more valuable
for GEO600 to continue more noise hunting and commissioning work, to
give as good a sensitivity as possible for when the LIGO detectors
went offline for upgrading. However, it did continue operating in night-and-weekend mode.


GEO600 continued operating in Astrowatch mode between November 2007 and July
2009 after which upgrades began. The plans for the GEO600 detector are to
continue to use it as a test-bed for more novel interferometric techniques
whilst focusing on increasing in sensitivity at higher frequencies (greater than
a few hundred Hz). This project is called GEO-HF~\cite{Willke:2006}. The
upgrading towards GEO-HF has been taking place since Summer
2009~\cite{Grote:2010}. The main upgrades started during 2009 were to
change the read-out scheme from an RF read-out to a DC read-out system~\cite{Hild:2009}
(also see Section~\ref{sec:readout}), install an output mode cleaner, place the
read-out system in vacuum, injecting squeezed light~\cite{Vahlbruch:2008,
Chelkowski:2007} into the output port, and finally increasing the input laser
power to 35~W. Running the interferometer with squeezed light will be the first
demonstration of a full-scale gravitational-wave detector operating beyond the
standard quantum limit. GEO-HF participated in S6 in an overnight and weekend
mode, alongside a commissioning schedule, and is continuing in this mode
following the end of S6.


\subsubsection{Virgo}


In summer 2002 Virgo completed the commissioning of the central area
interferometer, consisting of a power-recycled Michelson interferometer, but
without the 3~km Fabry--P\'{e}rot arm cavities. Over the next couple of years
various steps were made towards commissioning the full-size interferometer. In
early 2004 first lock with the 3~km arms was achieved, but without
power-recycling, and by the end of 2004 lock with power recycling was achieved.
During summer 2005 the commissioning runs provided order-of-magnitude
sensitivity improvements, with a peak sensitivity of
6~\texttimes~10\super{-22}~\Hz at 300~Hz, and an inspiral range
of over 1~Mpc. In late 2005 several major upgrades brought Virgo to
its final configuration. See~\cite{Acernese:2004, Acernese:2005,
Acernese:2006, Acernese:2007} for more detailed information on the
commissioning of the detector.


Virgo joined coincident observations with the LIGO and GEO600 S5 run with 10
weekend science runs (WSRs) starting in late 2006 until March 2007. Over this
time improvements were made mainly in the mid-to-low frequency regime
($\lesssim$~300~Hz). Full-time data taking, under the title of Virgo
Science run 1 (VSR1), began on 18 May 2007 and ended with the end of
S5 on 1 October 2007. During VSR1, the science-mode duty factor was
81\% and by the end of the run maximum neutron-star--binary inspiral
range was frequently up to about 4.5~Mpc. The best sensitivity curves
for WSR1, WSR10 and VSR1 can be seen in Figure~\ref{figure:Virgostrains}.


At the same time as commissioning for Enhanced LIGO was taking place there was
also a similar effort to upgrade the Virgo detector, called Virgo+. The main
upgrade was to the lasers to increase their power from 10 to 25~W at the input
mode cleaner, with upgrades also to the thermal compensation system on the
mirrors, the control electronics, mode cleaners and injection optics
\cite{Acernese:2008b, AdvVirgoWhitepaper}. Virgo+ started taking data
with Enhanced LIGO for Virgo Science Run 2 (VSR2) and sensitivities of
Virgo+ close to the initial Virgo design sensitivity were
reached. VSR2 finished on 8 January 2010 to allow for further
commissioning and noise hunting. This was followed by VSR3, which
began on 11 August 2010 and ran until 20 October 2010. Further Virgo+
runs are expected during 2011. Following these the upgrades to
Advanced Virgo will begin.
\subsection{Astrophysics results}
\label{subsection:results} 

Prior to the advent of the large scale interferometric detectors there had been
some limited effort to produce astrophysical results with the prototype
interferometers. The Caltech 40~m detector was used to search for, and set an
upper limit on, the gravitational wave emission from pulsar
\epubtkSIMBAD{PSR~J1939+2134}~\cite{Hereld:1984}, and on the rate of neutron star
binary inspirals in our galaxy, using coincident observations with the
University of Glasgow prototype~\cite{Smith:1988} and, more recently,
on its own~\cite{Allen:1999}. Coincident observations using the
prototype detectors at the University of Glasgow and Max Planck
Institute for Quantum Optics, in Garching, Germany, were used to set
an upper limit on the strain of gravitational wave bursts~\cite{Nicholson:1996}.
The Garching detector was used to search for periodic signals from pulsars, and
in particular set a limit on a potential source in
\epubtkSIMBAD{SN~1987A}~\cite{Niebauer:1993}. However since the start
of science data taking for the large scale detectors there has been a
rapid rise in the number, and scope, of science result papers being
published. With the vastly improved sensitivities pushing upper limits
on source populations and strengths towards astrophysically interesting areas.


The recent analysis efforts have generally been split into four broad areas
depending on the expected signal type: unmodelled transients or bursts, e.g.,
supernovae; modelled transients, e.g., inspirals and ring-downs (or more
specifically compact binary coalescences, CBC); continuous sources; stochastic
sources. Within each area a variety of different sources could exist and a
variety of analysis techniques have been developed to search for them. Some
electromagnetic sources, such as radio pulsars and $\gamma$-ray bursts, are also
used to enhance searches. A good review of the data analysis methods used in
current searches, and the astrophysical consequences of some of the results
described below, can be found in~\cite{Sathyaprakash:2009}.


Here we will briefly summarise the main astrophysics results from the science
runs. We will mainly focus on those produced by the LIGO Scientific
Collaboration~\cite{LSCweb} detectors LIGO and GEO600 from S1 to the S5 run.
At the time of writing not all of the data from the S6 run had been fully
analysed, with more results expected over the next year. Reviews of some early
S5, and prior science run, results can also be found in~\cite{Papa:2008,
Fairhurst:2009}. In none of the searches so far has convincing evidence for a
gravitational-wave signal been seen.


\subsubsection{Unmodelled bursts}
\label{subsubsection:unmodelled} 

Searches for unmodelled bursts, e.g., from supernova core-collapse, are based on
looking for short duration periods of excess power in the detectors. Transients
are common features in the data, so to veto these events from true gravitational-wave signals they must be coincident in time, and to some extent amplitude and
waveform, between multiple detectors. Various methods to assess instrumental
excess power, and inter-detector correlations, are used, some examples of which
can be found here~\cite{Klimenko:2004, Anderson:2001, Searle:2008, McNabb:2004,
Cadonati:2004, Chatterji:2004, Chatterji:2006}. These algorithms will produce
\textit{triggers} , which are periods of excess power that cross a predetermined
signal-to-noise ratio threshold (determined by tuning the algorithms on a
section of \textit{playground} data, so that the output produces a desired false
alarm rate). The number of triggers are then compared to a background rate. Real
signals cannot be turned off, and detectors cannot be shielded from them, so the
background rate has to be approximated by time shifting one detector's data
stream with respect the the others. Time shifts should only leave triggers due
to random coincidences in detector noise and there should be no contribution
from real signals. Once a background is calculated, the statistical significance
of the foreground rate can be compared to it. To assess the sensitivity of these
searches, hardware (the interferometer mirrors are physically moved via the
control system) and software signals are injected into the data stream at
various strengths and the efficiency of the algorithms at detecting them is
measured. A good description of some of these techniques can be found in
\cite{Abbott:2004b} and~\cite{Abbott:2006a}.


Data from the LIGO S1 run was searched for gravitational-wave bursts of between
4 to 100~ms, and within the frequency band 150 to 3000~Hz~\cite{Abbott:2004b}.
Triple coincident data from all three detectors was used for the analysis. No
plausible candidate event was found, but a 90\% confidence upper limit on the
event rate of 1.6 events per day was set. The search was typically sensitive, at
a $\gtrsim$~50\% detection efficiency, to bursts with amplitudes of
$h_{\mathrm{rss}}\sim10^{-19}$\,--\,$10^{-17} \mathrm{\ Hz}^{-1/2}$ (defined in
terms of $h_{\mathrm{rss}} \equiv \sqrt{\int|h|^2 \mathrm{d}t}$, which is the root-sum-squared strain
amplitude spectral density). Due, in part, to its lower sensitivity GEO600 data
was not used in this analysis. The S2 data's improved sensitivity, and advances
in the analysis techniques, allowed a sensitivity to signals (in the frequency
range 100\,--\,1100~Hz) in the amplitude range
$h_{\mathrm{rss}}\sim10^{-20}$\,--\,$10^{-19}\mathrm{\ Hz}^{-1/2}$~\cite{Abbott:2005a}. Interpreting the best
sensitivities astrophysically gave order of magnitude estimates on the
visible range of $\sim$~100~pc for a class of theoretical supernova waveforms,
and 1~Mpc for the merger of $50\,M_{\odot}$ black holes. Again no signal
was seen, but a 90\% upper limit of 0.26 events per day was set for strong
bursts. In the frequency range 700\,--\,2000~Hz TAMA300 data was also used in the
search giving amplitude sensitivities of
$h_{\mathrm{rss}}\sim1$\,--\,$3\times10^{-19}
\mathrm{\ Hz}^{-1/2}$ and decreasing the rate upper limit to 0.12
events per day~\cite{Abbott:2005c}.


The S3 run produced two searches for burst sources. One used the 8 days of
triple coincidence data from the three LIGO detectors to search for sub-second
bursts in the frequency range 100\,--\,1100~Hz~\cite{Abbott:2006a}. The search was
sensitive to signals with amplitudes over
$h_{\mathrm{rss}}\sim1\times10^{-20}\mathrm{\ Hz}^{-1/2}$, but did not
include an astrophysical interpretation of the limit or event rate
upper limit. This run included coincident operation with the Italian
AURIGA bar detector and this data has been
analysed~\cite{Baggio:2008}. This search looked for short bursts of
less than 20~ms within the 850\,--\,950~Hz band (around the bar's
sensitive resonant frequency). This had comparable sensitivity to the
LIGO-only S2 search and produced a 90\% confidence rate upper limit of
0.52 events/day.


For S4 15.5~days of LIGO data were searched for sub-second bursts in the
frequency range 64\,--\,1600~Hz~\cite{Abbott:2007b}. This was sensitive to signals
with $h_{\mathrm{rss}}\lesssim10^{-20}$ and set a 90\% confidence rate upper limit of
0.15 per day. The search results are also cast as astrophysical limits on source
ranges and energetics. These show that there would be a 50\% detection
efficiency to signals of sine-Gaussian nature (at the most sensitive frequency
of 153~Hz and quality factor $Q=8.9$) at a distance of 10~kpc for an energy of
$10^{-7}\,M_{\odot}c^2$, and would be sensitive to signals out to the Virgo
cluster ($\sim$~16~Mpc) for an energy release of $0.25\,M_{\odot}c^2$. See
\cite{Abbott:2007b} for a comparison of previous burst searches. There was also
a burst search combining S4 GEO600 and LIGO data for the first time. This
searched data between 768\,--\,2048~Hz where the sensitivities were most comparable
and used 257 hours of quadruple coincidence between the detectors and saw no
gravitational wave events~\cite{Abbott:2008b}.


For the analysis on the first year of S5 data the frequency range for the
all-sky burst search was split -- a low frequency search covered the most
sensitive region between 60\,--\,2000~Hz~\cite{Abbott:2009h}, and a high frequency
search covering 1\,--\,6~kHz (this being the first time an untriggered burst search
looked at frequencies above 3~kHz)~\cite{Abbott:2009i}. The high frequency
search set a 90\% upper limit on the rate of 5.4 events per year for strong
events. The low frequency search analysed more data than the high frequency and
set an event rate limit of 3.6 events per year. The second year of S5 LIGO data
was analysed with GEO600 and Virgo VSR1 data~\cite{Abadie:2010d} to search for
bursts over the whole 50\,--\,6000~Hz band. Combining this with the earlier S5
searches gave $h_{\mathrm{rss}}$ upper limits for a variety of
simulated waveforms of 6~\texttimes~10\super{-22}~\Hz to
2~\texttimes~10\super{-20}~\Hz, and a 90\% confidence event rate for
signals between 64\,--\,2048~Hz of less than two per year.


\subsubsection{Modelled bursts -- compact binary coalescence}
\label{sec:cbc} 

Modeled bursts generally mean the inspiral and coalescence stage of binaries
consisting of compact objects, e.g., neutron stars and black holes. The signals
are generally well approximated by post-Newtonian expansions of the Einstein
equation, which give the amplitude and phase evolution of the orbit. More
recently signal models have started to include numerical relativity simulations
of the merger stage~\cite{Aylott:2009}. As mentioned in
Section~\ref{section:construction} the best estimate of the number of signals
observable with initial LIGO at design sensitivity (i.e.\ during S5) would be
0.02 per year (based on an event rate of 1~\texttimes~10\super{-6} per year per MWEG).


The majority of inspiral searches make use of matched filtering in which a
template bank of signal models is built~\cite{Owen:1996, Owen:1999}, with a
maximum mismatch between templates that is generally of order $\sim$~10\%. These
templates are then cross-correlated with the data and statistically significant
\textit{triggers} (i.e.\ times when the template and data are highly correlated)
from this are looked for. Triggers must be coincident between detectors and the
significance of any trigger is judged against a background calculated in the
same way as described in Section~\ref{subsubsection:unmodelled}. See
\cite{Abbott:2005b} for a good description of the search method.


The first search for an inspiral signal with data from the LIGO S1 run looked
for compact object coalescences with component masses between $1$\,--\,$3\,M_{\odot}$
and was sensitive to such sources within the Milky Way and Magellanic
Clouds~\cite{Abbott:2004c}. It gave a 90\% confidence level upper
limit on the rate of 170 per year per MWEG.


For the S2 LIGO analysis the search was split into 3 areas covering neutron-star
binaries, black-hole binaries and primordial black-hole binaries in the galactic
halo. The neutron-star--binary search~\cite{Abbott:2005b} used 15 days of data
with coincidence between either H1 and L1 or H2 and L1. It had a range of
$\sim$~1.5~Mpc, which spanned the Local Group of galaxies, and gave a 90\% event
rate upper limit on systems with component masses of $1$\,--\,$3\,M_{\odot}$ of 47 per
year per MWEG. The black-hole--binary search looked for systems with component
masses in the $3$\,--\,$20\,M_{\odot}$ range using the same data set as the
neutron-star--binary search~\cite{Abbott:2006a}. This search had a 90\% detection
efficiency for sources out to 1\,Mpc and set a 90\% rate upper limit of 38 per
year per MWEG. The third search looked for low mass ($0.2$\,--\,$1\,M_{\odot}$)
primordial black-hole binaries in a 50~kpc radius halo surrounding the Milky
Way~\cite{Abbott:2005e}. This placed a 90\% confidence-rate upper limit of 63
events per year per Milky Way halo. The S2 search was performed in coincidence
with the TAMA300 DT8 period and an inspiral search for neutron-star binaries
was
performed on data when TAMA300 and at least one of the LIGO sites was
operational. This gave a total of 584~hours of data for the analysis, which set
a 90\% rate upper limit of 49 per year per MWEG, although this search was only
sensitive to sources within the majority of the Milky Way~\cite{Abbott:2006b}.


The search for neutron-star--black-hole binaries in S3 LIGO data used techniques
designed specifically for systems with spinning components. It searched for
systems with component masses in the range $1$\,--\,$20\,M_{\odot}$ and analysed 167
hours of triple coincident data and 548 hours of H1-H2 data to set the upper
limits~\cite{Abbott:2008d}. For a typical system with neutron-star and black-hole mass distributions centred on $1.35\,M_{\odot}$ and $5\,M_{\odot}$ (from
the population statistics discussed in~\cite{Abbott:2008a}) this search produced
a 90\% confidence-rate upper limit of 15.9 per year per $L_{10}$.


The search for a wide range of binary systems with components consisting of
primordial black holes, neutron stars, and black holes with masses in the ranges
given above was conducted on the combined S3 and S4 data~\cite{Abbott:2008a}.
788 hours of S3 data and 576 hours of S4 data were used and no plausible
gravitational-wave candidate was found. The highest mass range for the black-hole--binary search was set at $40\,M_{\odot}$ for S3 and $80\,M_{\odot}$ for S4. At peak in the
mass distribution of these sources 90\% confidence-rate upper limits were set at
4.9 per year per $L_{10}$ for primordial black holes, 1.2 per year per $L_{10}$
for neutron-star binaries, and 0.5 per year per $L_{10}$ for black-hole--binaries.
S4 data has also been used to search for ring-downs from perturbed black holes,
for example following black-hole-binary coalescence~\cite{Abbott:2009g}. The
search was sensitive to ring-downs from $10$\,--\,$500\,M_{\odot}$ black holes out to
a maximum range of 300~Mpc, and produced a best 90\% confidence upper limit on
the rate of ring-downs to be 1.6~\texttimes~10\super{-3} per year per
$L_{10}$ for the mass range $85$\,--\,$390\,M_{\odot}$.


One other kind of modeled burst search is that looking for gravitational waves
produced by cusps in cosmic (super)strings. Just over two weeks of LIGO S4 data
were used to search for such signals~\cite{Abbott:2009j}. This was used to
constrain the rate and parameter space (string tension, reconnection
probability, and loop sizes), but was not able to beat limits set by Big Bang
nucleosynthesis.


Data from the first~\cite{Abbott:2009e} and second year of S5 (prior to Virgo
joining with VSR1)~\cite{Abbott:2009f} have been searched for low-mass binary
coalescences with total masses in the range $2$\,--\,$35\,M_{\odot}$. The second
year search results have produced the more stringent upper limits with 90\%
confidence rates for neutron-star-binaries, black-hole-binaries and neutron-star--black-hole systems respectively of 1.4~\texttimes~10\super{-2},
7.3~\texttimes~10\super{-4} and 3.6~\texttimes~10\super{-3} per year
per $L_{10}$. Five months of overlapping S5 and VSR1 data were also
searched for the same range of signals~\cite{Abadie:2010f} giving 90\%
confidence upper rates of 8.7~\texttimes~10\super{-3} per year per
$L_{10}$, 2.2~\texttimes~10\super{-3} per year per $L_{10}$, and
4.4~\texttimes~10\super{-4} per year per $L_{10}$. The whole 2 years
of LIGO S5 data were also used to search for higher mass binary
coalescences with component mass between $1$\,--\,$99\,M_{\odot}$
and total masses of $25$\,--\,$100\,M_{\odot}$. No signal was
seen, but a 90\% confidence upper limit rate on mergers of black-hole--binary systems with component masses between 19 and
$28\,M_{\odot}$, and with negligible spin, was set at
2.0~Mpc\super{-3}~Myr\super{-1} \cite{Abadie:2011a}.


\subsubsection{Externally-triggered burst searches}


Many gravitational wave burst sources will be associated with electromagnetic
(or neutrino) counterparts, for example short $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) are
potentially caused by black-hole and neutron-star coalescences. Joint
observation of a source as both a gravitational wave and electromagnetic
event also greatly increases the confidence in a detection. Therefore many
searches have been performed to look for bursts coincident (temporally and
spatially) with external electromagnetic triggers, such as GRBs observed by
Swift for example. These searches have used both excess power and modeled
matched-filter methods to look for signals.


During S2 a particularly bright $\gamma$-ray burst event (\epubtkSIMBAD{GRB~030329}) occurred
and was specifically targeted using data from H1 and H2. The search looked for
signals with duration less than $\sim$~150~ms and in the frequency range
80\,--\,2048~Hz~\cite{Abbott:2005d}. This produced a best strain upper limit for an
unpolarised signal around the most sensitive region at  $\sim$~250~Hz
of $h_{\mathrm{rss}}=6\times10^{-21} \mathrm{\ Hz}^{-1/2}$.


For S4 there were two burst searches targeting specific sources. The first
target was the hyperflare from the Soft $\gamma$-ray Repeater \epubtkSIMBAD{SGR~1806--20}
(SGRs are thought to be ``magnetars'', neutron stars with extremely large
magnetic fields of order 10\super{15}~Gauss) on 27 December 2004
\cite{Hurley:2005} (this actually occurred before S4 in a period when only the
H1 detector was operating). The search looked for signals at frequencies
corresponding to short duration quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in
the X-ray light curve following the flare~\cite{Abbott:2007c}. The most
sensitive 90\% upper limit was for the 92.5~Hz QPO at $h_{\mathrm{rss}} =
4.5\times10^{-22} \mathrm{\ Hz}^{-1/2}$, which corresponds to an energy emission limit
of $4.3\times10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}c^2$ (of the same order as the total
electromagnetic emission assuming isotropy). The other search used LIGO data
from S2, S3 and S4 to look for signals associated with 39 short duration
$\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) that occurred in coincidence with these
runs~\cite{Abbott:2008c}. The GRB triggers were provided by IPN,
Konus-Wind, HETE-2, INTEGRAL and Swift as distributed by the GRB
Coordinate Network~\cite{GCN}. The search looked in a 180-second
window around the burst peak time (120 seconds before and 60 seconds
after) and for each burst there were at least two detectors
contributing data. No signal coincident with a GRB was observed and
the sensitivities were not enough to give any meaningful astrophysical
constraints, although simulations suggest that for S4, as in the general burst
search, it would have been sensitive to sine-Gaussian signals out to tens of Mpc
for an energy release of order a solar mass.


The first search of Virgo data in coincidence with a GRB was performed on data
from a commissioning run in September 2005. The long duration \epubtkSIMBAD{GRB~050915a} was
observed by Swift on 15 September 2005 and Virgo data was used to search for an
unmodelled burst in a window of 180 seconds around (120~s before and 60~s after)
the GRB peak time~\cite{Acernese:2008a}. The search produced a strain upper
limit of order 10\super{-20} in the frequency range 200\,--\,1500~Hz, but was mainly
used as a test-bed for setting up the methodology for future searches, including
coincidence analysis with LIGO.


Data from the S5 run has been used to search for signals associated with even
more $\gamma$-ray bursts. One search looked specifically for emissions from
\epubtkSIMBAD{GRB~070201}~\cite{Golenetskii:2007a, Golenetskii:2007b}, which showed 
evidence of originating in the nearby Andromeda galaxy (\epubtkSIMBAD{M31}). The data
around the time of this burst was used to look for an unmodelled burst and an
inspiral signal as might be expected from a short GRB. The analysis saw no
gravitational-wave event associated with the GRB, but ruled out the event being
a neutron-star--binary inspiral located in \epubtkSIMBAD{M31} with a 99\% confidence
\cite{Abbott:2008g}. Again, assuming a neutron-star--binary inspiral, but located
outside \epubtkSIMBAD{M31}, the analysis set a 90\% confidence limit that the source must be at
a distance greater than 3.5~Mpc. Assuming a signal again located in M31, the
unmodelled burst search set an upper limit on the energy emitted via
gravitational waves of $4.4\times10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}c^2$, which was
well within the allowable range for this being an SGR hyper-flare in \epubtkSIMBAD{M31}.
Searches for 137 GRBs (both short and long GRBs) that were observed, mainly with
the Swift satellite, during S5 and VSR1 have been performed again using
unmodelled burst methods~\cite{Abbott:2009d} and for (22 short bursts) inspiral
signals~\cite{Abadie:2010b}. No evidence for a gravitational-wave signal
coincident with these events was seen. The unmodeled burst observations were
used to set lower limits on the distance to each GRB, with typical limits,
assuming isotropic emission, at
$D\sim15\mathrm{\ Mpc}(E^{\mathrm{iso}}_{\mathrm{GW}}/0.01\,M_{\odot}c^2)^{1/2}$. The
inspiral search, which was sensitive to CBCs with total system masses
between $2\,M_{\odot}$ and $40\,M_{\odot}$, was able to exclude with
90\% confidence any bursts being neutron-star--black-hole mergers
within 6.7~Mpc, although the peak distance distribution of GRBs is
well beyond this.


Another search has been to look for gravitational waves associated with flares
from known SGRs and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), both of which are thought to
be \textit{magnetars}. During the first year of S5 there were 191 (including the
December 2004 \epubtkSIMBAD{SGR~1806--20} event) observed flares from SGRs \epubtkSIMBAD[SGR~1806--20]{1806--20} and
\epubtkSIMBAD[SGR~1900+14]{1900+14} for which at least one LIGO detector was online~\cite{Abbott:2008h}, and
1279 flare events if extending that to six known galactic magnetars and
including all S5 and post-S5 Astrowatch data including Virgo and
GEO600~\cite{Abadie:2010c}. The data around each event was searched
for ring-down signals in the frequency range 1\,--\,3~kHz and with
decay times 100\,--\,400~ms as might be expected from \textit{f}-mode
oscillations in a neutron star. It was also searched for unmodeled
bursts in the 100\,--\,1000~Hz range. No gravitational bursts were
seen from any of the events. For the earlier
search~\cite{Abbott:2008h} the lowest 90\% upper limit on the
gravitational-wave energy from the ring-down search was $E_{\mathrm{GW}}^{90\%} =
2.4\times10^{48}\mathrm{\ erg}$ for an \epubtkSIMBAD{SGR~1806--20} burst on 24 August 2006. The
lowest 90\% upper limit on the unmodeled search was
$E_{\mathrm{GW}}^{90\%} = 2.9\times10^{45}\mathrm{\ erg}$ for an \epubtkSIMBAD{SGR~1806--20}
burst on 21 July 2006. The smallest limits on the ratio of energy
emitted via gravitational waves to that emitted in the electromagnetic
spectrum were of order 10\,--\,100, which are into a theoretically-allowed range. The latter search~\cite{Abadie:2010c} gave the lowest
gravitational-wave emission-energy upper limits for white noise bursts
in the detector-sensitive band, and for \textit{f}-mode ring-downs (at
1090~Hz), of 3.0~\texttimes~10\super{44}~erg and
1.4~\texttimes~10\super{47}~erg respectively, assuming a distance of
1~kpc. The \textit{f}-mode energy limits approach the range seen emitted
electromagnetically during giant flares. One of these flares, on 29
March 2006, was actually a ``storm'' of many flares from
\epubtkSIMBAD{SGR~1900+14}. For this event a more sensitive search has been performed
by stacking data around the time of each
flare~\cite{Abbott:2009c}. Waveform dependent upper limits of the
gravitational-wave energy emitted were set between
2~\texttimes~10\super{45}~erg and 6~\texttimes~10\super{50}~erg, which
are an order of magnitude lower than the previous upper limit for this
storm (included in the search of~\cite{Abbott:2008h}) and overlap with
the range of electromagnetic energies emitted in SGR giant flares.


Another possible source of gravitational waves associated with
electromagnetically-observed phenomenon are pulsar glitches. During these it is
possible that various gravitational-wave--emitting vibrational modes of the
pulsar may be excited. A search has been performed for fundamental modes
(\textit{f}-modes) in S5 data following a glitch observed in the
timing of the \epubtkSIMBAD{Vela} pulsar in August
2006~\cite{Abadie:2010a}. Over the search frequency range of
1\,--\,3~kHz this provided upper limits on the peak strain of
0.6\,--\,1.4~\texttimes~10\super{-20} depending on the spherical
harmonic that was excited. 


Already efforts are under way to invert this process of searching gravitational-wave data for external triggers, and instead supplying gravitational-wave burst
triggers for electromagnetic follow-up. This is being investigated across the
range of the electromagnetic spectrum from radio~\cite{Predoi:2010}, through
optical (e.g.,~\cite{Kanner:2008, Coward:2010}) and X-ray/$\gamma$-ray, and even
looking for coincidence with neutrino detectors~\cite{Aso:2008, Pradier:2010,
Chassande:2010}. Having \textit{multi-messenger} observations can have a
large impact on the amount of astrophysical information that can be learnt about
an event~\cite{Phinney:2009}.


\subsubsection{Continuous sources}


Searches for continuous waves focus on rapidly-spinning neutron stars as
sources. There are fully targeted searches, which look for gravitational waves
from known radio pulsars in which the position and spin evolution of the objects
are precisely known. There are semi-targeted searches, which look at potential
sources in which some, but not all, the source signal parameters are known, for
example neutron stars in X-ray binary systems, or sources in supernova remnants
where no pulses are seen, which have known position, but unknown frequency.
Finally, there are all-sky broadband searches in which none of the signal
parameters are known. The targeted searches tend to be most sensitive as they
are able to perform coherent integration over long stretches of data with
relatively low computational overheads, and have a much smaller parameter space
leading to fewer statistical outliers. Due to various neutron-star population
statistics, creation rates and energetics arguments, there is an estimate that
the amplitude of the strongest gravitational-wave pulsar observed at Earth will
be $h_0 \lesssim 4\times10^{-24}$~\cite{Abbott:2007a} (a more thorough
discussion of this argument can be found in~\cite{Knispel:2008}), although this
does not rule out stronger sources.


The various search techniques used to produce these results all look for
statistically-significant excess power in narrow frequency bins that have been
Doppler demodulated to take into account the signal's shifting frequency caused
by the Earth's orbital motion with respect to the source (or also including the
modulations to the signal caused by the source's own motion relative to the
Earth, such as for a pulsar in a binary system). The statistical significance of
a measured level of excess power is compared to what would be expected from data
that consisted of Gaussian noise alone. A selection of the searches are
summarised in~\cite{Prix:2006}, but for more detailed descriptions of the
various methods see~\cite{Brady:2000, Krishnan:2004, Jaranowski:1998,
Abbott:2008e, Abbott:2007a, Dupuis:2005}.


In S1 a fully-coherent targeted search for gravitational waves from the then-fastest millisecond pulsar J1939+2134 was performed~\cite{Abbott:2004d}. This
analysis and the subsequent LSC known-pulsar searches assume that the star is
triaxial and emitting gravitational waves at exactly twice its rotation
frequency. All the data from LIGO and GEO600 was analysed and no evidence of a
signal was seen. A 95\% degree-of-belief upper limit on the gravitational-wave
strain amplitude was set using data from the most sensitive detector, L1, giving
a value of 1.4~\texttimes~10\super{-22}. This result was also interpreted as an
ellipticity of the star given a canonical moment of inertia of
10\super{38}~kg~m\super{2} at
$\epsilon$~=~2.9~\texttimes~10\super{-4}.  However, this was still of
order 100\,000 times higher than the limit that can be set by equating
the star's rate of loss of rotational kinetic energy with that emitted
via gravitational radiation -- called the ``spin-down limit''.


In S2 the number of known pulsar sources searched for with LIGO data increased
from 1 to 28, although all of these were isolated pulsars (i.e.\, not in binary
systems, although potentially still associated with supernova remnants or
globular clusters). This search used pulsar timing data supplied by Lyne
and Kramer from Jodrell Bank Observatory to precisely reconstruct the
phase of the gravitational-wave signal over the period of the run. The lowest
95\% upper limit on gravitational-waves amplitude was
1.7~\texttimes~10\super{-24} for \epubtkSIMBAD{PSR~J1910--5959D}, and the smallest
upper limit on ellipticity (again assuming the canonical moment of
inertia) was 4.5~\texttimes~10\super{-6} for the relatively-close
pulsar \epubtkSIMBAD{PSR~J2124--3358}~\cite{Abbott:2005f}, at a distance of
0.25~kpc. The pulsar closest to its inferred spin-down limit was the
Crab pulsar (\epubtkSIMBAD{PSR~J0534+2200}) with an upper limit 30 times greater than
that from spin-down. S2 also saw the use of two different all-sky--wide
frequency band searches that focused on isolated sources, but also
including a search for gravitational waves from the low mass X-ray
binary Scorpius~X1 (\epubtkSIMBAD[V818~Sco]{Sco-X1}). The first search used a semi-coherent
technique to search $\sim$~60~days of S2 data in the frequency band
between 200\,--\,400~Hz and with signal spin-downs between
--1.1~\texttimes~10\super{-9} and
0~Hz~s\super{-1}~\cite{Abbott:2005g}. This gave a lowest gravitational-wave strain 95\% upper limit of 4.4~\texttimes~10\super{-23} for the
L1 detector at around 200~Hz. The other all-sky search was fully
coherent and as such was computationally limited to only use a few
hours of the most sensitive S2 data. It searched frequencies between
160\,--\,728.8~Hz and spin-downs less than
--4~\texttimes~10\super{-10}~Hz~s\super{-1} for isolated sources and
gave a 95\% upper limit across this band from
6.6~\texttimes~10\super{-23} to 1~\texttimes~10\super{-21}~\cite{Abbott:2007a}. The search for gravitational waves from \epubtkSIMBAD[V818~Sco]{Sco-X1} used the
same period of data. It did not have to search over sky position as this is well
known, but did have to search over two binary orbital parameters -- the projected
semi-major axis and the orbital phase reference time. The frequency ranges of
this search relied on estimates of the spin-frequency from quasi-periodic
oscillations in the X-rays from the source and covered two 20~Hz bands from
464\,--\,484~Hz and 604\,--\,624~Hz (it should be noted that it is now
thought that these estimates of the spin-frequency are unreliable). In
these two ranges upper limits of 1.7~\texttimes~10\super{-22} and
1.3~\texttimes~10\super{-21} were found respectively.


One search that was carried out purely on LIGO S3 data was the coherent all-sky
wide-band isolated pulsar search using the distributed computing project
Einstein@Home~\cite{eath}. The project is built upon the Berkeley Open
Infrastructure for Network Computing~\cite{BOINC} and allows the computational
workload to be distributed among many computers generally contributed by the
general public who sign up to the project. This used the most sensitive 600
hours of data from H1 and cut it into 60 ten hour stretches on each of which
a coherent search could be performed. The data was farmed out to computers owned
by participants in the project and ran as a background process or screen saver.
The search band spanned the range from 50\,--\,1500.5~Hz. The search saw no
plausible gravitational-wave candidates and the result is described
at~\cite{eathS3}, but it was not used to produce an upper limit.


In the known pulsar search the number of sources searched for using the combined
LIGO data from S3 and S4 was increased to 78. This included many pulsars within
binary systems. For many of the pulsars that overlapped with the previous S2
analysis results were improved by about an order of magnitude. The lowest 95\%
upper limit on gravitational-waves amplitude was 2.6~\texttimes~10\super{-25} for
\epubtkSIMBAD{PSR~~J1603--7202}, and the smallest ellipticity was again for \epubtkSIMBAD{PSR~J2124--3358}
at just less than 10\super{-6}~\cite{Abbott:2007d}. The upper limit for the Crab
pulsar was found to be only 2.2 times above that from the spin-down limit. Three
different, but related, semi-coherent all-sky continuous wave searches were
performed on S4 LIGO data, looking for isolated neutron stars in the frequency
range from 50\,--\,1000~Hz and the spin-down range from --1~\texttimes~10\super{-8}
to 0~Hz~s\super{-1}~\cite{Abbott:2008e}. The best 95\% upper limit based on an
isotropically-distributed, randomly-oriented, population of neutron stars was
4.3~\texttimes~10\super{-24} near 140~Hz. This is approaching the amplitude of the
strongest potential signal discussed above. For one of the searches, which
combined data from the different detectors, an isolated pulsar emitting at near
100~Hz, and with an extreme ellipticity of 10\super{-4} could have been seen at a
distance of 1~kpc, although for a more realistic ellipticity of 10\super{-8} only
a distance of less than 1~pc would be visible over the entire LIGO band. The
Einstein@Home project~\cite{eath} was also used to search the most sensitive
data from S4, which consisted of 300 hours of H1 data and 210 hours of L1 data.
The search performed a coherent analysis on 30-hour stretches of this data and
covered the frequency range of 50\,--\,1500~Hz~\cite{Abbott:2008f}. The range
of spin-downs $\dot{f}$ was chosen by using a minimum spin-down age $\tau$ and
having $-f/\tau < \dot{f} < 0.1f/\tau$ (small spin-ups are allowed as some
pulsars in globular clusters exhibit this due to their Doppler motions within
the clusters), with $\tau$~= 1000~years for signals below 300~Hz and
$\tau$~= 10\,000~years above 300~Hz. Approximately 6000 years of computational time
spread over about 100\,000 computers were required to perform the analysis. No
plausible gravitational-wave candidates were found, although the results suggest
that 90\% of sources with strain amplitudes greater than 10\super{-23} would have
been detected by the search. A search designed to produce a sky map of the
stochastic background was also used to search for gravitational waves from
\epubtkSIMBAD[V818~Sco]{Sco-X1} using a method of cross-correlating H1 and L1 data~\cite{Abbott:2007f}.
This produced a 90\% root-mean-squared upper limit on gravitational wave strain
of $h = 3.4\times10^{-24}(f/200 \mathrm{\ Hz})$ for frequencies greater than 200 Hz.


The first 8 months of S5 have been used to perform an all-sky search for
periodic gravitational waves. This search used a semi-coherent method to look
in the frequency range 50\,--\,1100~Hz and spin-down range
--5~\texttimes~10\super{-9}\,--\,0~Hz~s\super{2} and used data from
the H1 and L1 detectors~\cite{Abbott:2008i}. It obtained 95\% strain
upper limits of less than 10\super{-24} over a frequency band of
200~Hz. The search would have been sensitive to a neutron star with
equatorial ellipticity greater than 10\super{-6} within around
500~pc. Einstein@Home~\cite{eath} has been used to search for periodic
waves of 50\,--\,1500~Hz in 860 hours of data from a total span
of 66 days of S5 data \cite{Abbott:2009a}. This search looked for
young pulsars, but saw no significant candidates. It would have been
sensitive to 90\% of sources in the 125\,--\,225~Hz band with
amplitudes greater than 3~\texttimes~10\super{-24}. The first
approximately 9~months of S5 data was used for a coherent search for
gravitational waves from the Crab pulsar~\cite{Abbott:2008j}. In this
search two methods were used: the first followed the method of the targeted
search and assumed that the gravitational waves are phase locked to
the electromagnetic pulses; the second allowed for some mechanism,
which would cause a small mismatch between the two phases. Two 95\%
upper limits were set, one using astrophysical
constraints on the pulsar orientation angle and polarisation angle~\cite{Ng:2008}
and the other applying no such constraints. With the first method these 95\%
upper limits were 3.4~\texttimes~10\super{-25} and 2.7~\texttimes~10\super{-25} respectively,
which correspond to ellipticities of 1.8~\texttimes~10\super{-4} and 1.4~\texttimes~10\super{-4}
(assuming the canonical moment of inertia). These beat the Crab pulsar's
spin-down limit by 4 to 5 times and can be translated into the amount of the
available spin-down power that is emitted via gravitational waves, with the
lower of these limits showing that less than 4\% of power is going into
gravitational waves. For the second search the uniform and restricted prior analyses gave
upper limits of 1.7~\texttimes~10\super{-24} and 1.2~\texttimes~10\super{-24}
respectively. The whole of S5 was used to search for emissions from 116 known
pulsars~\cite{Abbott:2010a}. During this search the Crab limit was further
brought down to be less than a factor of 7 below the spin-down limit, and the
spin-down limit is reached for one other pulsar \epubtkSIMBAD{PSR~J0537--6910}. Of the other
pulsars, the best (lowest) upper limit on gravitational-wave amplitude was
2.3~\texttimes~10\super{-26} for \epubtkSIMBAD{PSR~J1603--7202} and our best (lowest) limit on the
inferred pulsar ellipticity is 7.0~\texttimes~10\super{-8} for \epubtkSIMBAD{PSR~J2124--3358}.


A semi-targeted search was performed with 12 days of S5 data, although this time
searching for a source with a known position in the Cassiopeia~A (\epubtkSIMBAD{Cas~A})
supernova remnant, but for which there is no known frequency. The
search~\cite{Abadie:2010g} looked in the frequency band between
100\,--\,300~Hz and covered a wide range of first and second frequency
derivatives and no signal was seen, but it gave 95\% amplitude and
ellipticity upper limits over the band of
(0.7\,--\,1.2)~\texttimes~10\super{-24} and
(0.4\,--\,4)~\texttimes~10\super{-4} respectively. These results beat
indirect limits on the emission based on energy-conservation arguments
(similar, but not the same as the spin-down limits) and were also the
first results to be cast as limits on the \textit{r}-mode amplitude~\cite{Owen:2010}.


The Vela pulsar has a spin frequency of $\sim$~11~Hz and was not accessible with
current LIGO data.  However, Virgo VSR2 data had sensitivity in the low
frequency band that made a search for it worthwhile. Using $\sim$~150~days of
Virgo data, three semi-independent methods were used to search for the
Vela pulsar \cite{Abadie:2011b}. No signal was seen, but a 95\% upper limit on
the amplitude of $\sim$~2~\texttimes~10\super{-24} was set, which beat the spin-down limit
by $\sim$~1.6 times. Other than the Crab pulsar, this is currently the only other
object for which the spin-down limit has been beaten.


\subsubsection{Stochastic sources}


Searches are conducted for a cosmological, or astrophysical, background of
gravitational waves that would show up as a coherent stochastic noise source
between detectors. This is done by performing a cross-correlation of data from
two detectors as described in~\cite{Allen:1999b}.


In S1 the most sensitive detector pair for this correlation was H2--L1 (the H1--H2
pair are significantly hampered by local environmental correlations) and they
gave a 90\% confidence upper limit of $\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}} < 44\pm9$\epubtkFootnote{The
result published in~\cite{Abbott:2004e} give an upper limit value of
$\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}} < 23$, but this is for a Hubble constant
of 100~km~s\super{-1}~Mpc\super{-1}, so for consistency with later results it has
been converted to use a Hubble constant of 72~km~s\super{-1}~Mpc\super{-1} as in
\cite{Abbott:2005h}.} within the 40\,--\,314~Hz band, where the upper limit is in
units of closure density of the universe and for a Hubble constant in units of
72~km~s\super{-1}~Mpc\super{-1}~\cite{Abbott:2004e}. This limit was several times
better than previous direct-detector limits, but still well above the
concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology value of the \textit{total} energy density of
the universe of $\Omega_0\approx1$ (see, e.g.,~\cite{Jarosik:2010}).


No published stochastic background search was performed on S2 data, but S3 data
was searched and gave an upper limit that improved on the S1 result by a factor
of $\sim$~10\super{5}. The most sensitive detector pair for this search was H1--L1 for
which 218 hours of data were used~\cite{Abbott:2005h}. Upper limits were set for
three different power-law spectra of the gravitational-wave background. For a
flat spectra, as predicted by some inflationary and cosmic string models, a 90\%
confidence upper limit of $\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}(f) = 8.4\times10^{-4}$ in the
69\,--\,156~Hz range was set (again for a Hubble constant of
72~km~s\super{-1}~Mpc\super{-1}). This is still about 60 times greater than a
conservative bound on primordial gravitational waves set by big-bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN). For a quadratic power law, as predicted for a
superposition of rotating neutron-star signals, an upper limit of
$\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}(f) = 9.4\times10^{-4}(f/100 \mathrm{\ Hz})^2$ was set in the range 73\,--\,244~Hz,
and for a cubic power law, from some pre-Big-Bang cosmology models, an upper
limit of $\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}(f) = 8.1\times10^{-4}(f/100 \mathrm{\ Hz})^3$ in the range
76\,--\,329~Hz was produced.


For S4 $\sim$~354~hours of H1--L1 data and $\sim$~333~hours of H2--L1 data were
used to set a 90\% upper limit of $\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}(f) < 6.5\times10^{-5}$ on
the stochastic background between 51\,--\,150~Hz, for a flat spectrum and Hubble
constant of 72~km~s\super{-1}~Mpc\super{-1}~\cite{Abbott:2007e}. This result is
still several times higher than BBN limits. About 20 days of H1 and L1 S4 data
was also used to produce an upper limit map on the gravitational wave background
across the sky as would be appropriate if there was an anisotropic background
dominated by distinct sources~\cite{Abbott:2007f}. This search covered a
frequency range between 50\,--\,1800~Hz and had spectral \textit{power} limits (which
come from the square of the amplitude $h$) ranging from
$1.2\times10^{-48} \mathrm{\ Hz}^{-1} (100 \mathrm{\ Hz}/f)^3$ and
$1.2\times10^{-47} \mathrm{\ Hz}^{-1} (100 \mathrm{\ Hz}/f)^3$ for an
$f^{-3}$ source power spectrum, and limits of
8.5~\texttimes~10\super{-49}~Hz\super{-1} and
6.1~\texttimes~10\super{-48}~Hz\super{-1} for a flat spectrum.


Data from S4 was also used to perform the first cross-correlation between an
interferometric and bar detector to search for stochastic backgrounds. L1 data
and data from the nearby ALLEGRO bar detector were used to search in the
frequency range 850\,--\,950~Hz, several times higher than the LIGO only
searches~\cite{Abbott:2007g}. A 90\% upper limit on the closure
density of $\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}(f) \leq 1.02$ (for the above Hubble
constant) was set, which beat previous limits in that frequency range
by two orders of magnitude. This limit beats what would be achievable
with LLO-LHO cross correlation of S4 data in this frequency range by a
factor of several tens, due to the physical proximity of LLO and ALLEGRO.


The entire two years of S5 data from the LIGO detectors has been used to set a
limit on the stochastic background around 100~Hz to be $\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}(f) <
6.9\times10^{-6}$ at 95\% confidence (for a flat gravitational-wave spectrum)
\cite{Abbott:2009b}. This now beats the indirect limits provided by BBN and cosmic microwave background observations.


\subsection{Detector upgrades}


All the current detectors have upgrades planned over the next several years.
These upgrades will give rise to the second generation of gravitational-wave
detectors, which should start to open up gravitational-wave astronomy as a
real observational tool. There are also currently plans being made for third
generation detectors, which could provide the premier gravitational-wave
observatories for the first half of the century. A brief summary of the planned
upgrades to current and future detectors is given below. An overview can be also
be found here~\cite{Whitcomb:2008}. Some of the technologies for these upgrades
are discussed earlier in this review (e.g.\, Section~\ref{section:interferometry}).


\subsubsection{Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and LCGT}
\label{subsection:aligo} 

Advanced LIGO (aLIGO)~\cite{Harry:2010, AdvLIGO, AdvLIGOweb} and Advanced Virgo
(AdvVirgo)~\cite{AdvVirgoDesign, AdvVirgoweb} are the second generation
detectors. They are planned to have a sensitivity increase over the levels of
the initial detectors by a factor of 10\,--\,15 times. These increased sensitivity
levels would expand the volume of space observed by the detectors by $\sim$~1000
times meaning that there is a realistic detection rate of neutron-star--binary
coalescences of around 40~yr\super{-1}~\cite{Abadie:2010e, Kopparapu:2008}.
The technological issues required to reach these sensitivities, such as choice
of test mass and mirror coating materials, suspension design, interferometric
layout, control and readout, would need a separate review article to themselves,
but we shall very briefly summarise them here.


Advanced LIGO will consist of three 4~km detectors in the current LIGO vacuum
system; two at the Hanford site\epubtkFootnote{There is currently a plan that
has been approved by the LIGO Laboratory and the NSF to potentially construct
one of the Hanford detectors at a site in Australia~\cite{Marx:2010}, although
this is reliant on construction and running costs being provided by the
Australian government. Such an observatory in the southern hemisphere would
greatly improve sky localisation of any transient sources and enhance
electromagnetic follow-up observations (e.g.,~\cite{Barriga:2010}).} and one at
Livingston. It will apply some of the technologies from the GEO600
interferometer, such as the use of a signal recycling mirror at the output port
and monolithic silica suspensions for the test masses, rather than the current
steel wire slings. Larger test masses will be used with an increase from 11 to
40 kg, although the masses will still be made from fused silica. The mirror
coating is likely to consist of multiple alternating layers of silica and
tantala, with the tantala layers doped with titania to reduce the coating
thermal noise~\cite{Agresti:2006}. The seismic isolation systems will be
replaced with improved versions offering a seismic cut-off frequency
of $\sim$~10~Hz as opposed to the current cut-off of $\sim$~40~Hz. As
stated for Enhanced LIGO (in Section~\ref{sec:ligoruns}), the laser
power will be greater than for initial LIGO and a DC readout scheme
will be used. Initial/Enhanced LIGO was shut down to begin the
installation of these upgrades on 20 October 2010. The design strain
amplitude sensitivity curve for aLIGO (and AdvVirgo and LCGT) is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:advcurves}.

  
  
  AdvVirgo will apply similar upgrades to those for aLIGO and over a similar
timescale (for details see~\cite{AdvVirgoWhitepaper} and~\cite{AdvVirgoDesign}). Plans are
to add a signal recycling mirror, monolithic suspensions, increased laser power
to $\sim$~200~W, improved coatings, and to potentially use non-Gaussian beams (see,
e.g.,~\cite{Freise:2010}), although this option is unlikely. The seismic isolation
system will not be changed. Virgo will shut down to begin these upgrades in July
2011.


The Large-scale Cryogenic Gravitational-Wave Telescope (LCGT)
\cite{Miyoki:2005, Ohashi:2008, Kuroda:2010} is a planned Japanese detector to
be sited underground in the Kamioka mine. The LGCT will consist of a detector
with 3~km arms, using sapphire mirrors and sapphire suspensions. Initially it
will operate at room temperature, but will later be cooled to cryogenic
temperatures. This detector is planned to have similar sensitivities
to aLIGO and AdvVirgo, with a reach for binary coalescences of about 200~Mpc
with SNR of 10. There currently exists a technology demonstrator called the
Cryogenic Laser Interferometer Observatory (CLIO)~\cite{Yamamoto:2008, CLIOweb},
which has a 100~m baseline and is also sited in the Kamioka mine. This is to
demonstrate the very stable conditions (i.e.,\ low levels of seismic noise)
existing in the mine and also the cryogenically-cooled sapphire mirrors
suspended from aluminium wires. In experiments with CLIO at room temperature
(i.e.\, 300~K), using a metallic glass called Bolfur for its wire suspensions, it
has already been used to produce an astrophysics result by looking for
gravitational waves from the Vela pulsar~\cite{Akutsu:2008}, giving a 99.4\%
confidence upper limit of $h$~=~5.3~\texttimes~10\super{-20}. Tests with the cryogenic
system activated and using aluminium suspensions allowed two mirrors to be
cooled to $\sim$~14~K.


Having a network of comparably-sensitive detectors spread widely across the
globe is vital to gain the fullest astrophysical insight into transient sources.
Position reconstruction for sources relies on triangulating the location based
on time-of-flight delays observed between detectors. Therefore, having long
baselines, and different planes between as many detectors as possible, gives the
best positional reconstruction -- in~\cite{Fairhurst:2010} it is shown that for
the 2 US aLIGO sites sky localisation will be on the order of 1000 square degrees,
whereas this can be brought down to a few square degrees with the inclusion of
more sites and detectors. Observation with multiple detectors also provides the
best way to give confidence that a signal is a real gravitational wave rather
than the accidental coincidence of background noise. Finally, multiple,
differently-oriented, detectors will increase the ability to reconstruct a
transient sources waveform and polarisation.


\subsubsection{Third-generation detectors}
\label{subsec:et} 

Currently design studies are under way for a third-generation gravitational-wave
observatory called the Einstein Telescope (ET)~\cite{ETweb}. This is a European
Commission funded study with working groups looking into various aspects of the
design including the site location and characteristics (e.g.\, underground),
suspensions technologies; detector topology and geometry (e.g.\, an equilateral
triangle configuration); and astrophysical aims. The preliminary plan is to
aim for an observatory, which improves upon the second-generation detectors by
an order of magnitude over a broad band. There are many technological challenges
to be faced in attempting to make this a reality and research is currently under
way into a variety of these issues.


Investigations into the interferometric configuration have already been studied
(see~\cite{Freise:2008, Hild:2008, Hild:2010}), with suggestions including a
triple interferometer system made up from an equilateral triangle, an
underground location, and potentially a xylophone configuration (two independent
detectors covering different frequency ranges, i.e., ultimately giving six
detectors in total, although constructed over a period of years). Three
potential sensitivity curves are plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:etsens} for different
configurations of detectors.
