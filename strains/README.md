# Interferomter sensitivity curves

This directory contains a selection of strain sensitivity curves for a variety of interferometric gravitational wave detectors.
Some are real measured strains, whilst some are theoretical strains for current or future detectors.

## LIGO

The sensitivity curves for the LIGO detectors from science runs S1 to S6 are taken from [here](https://labcit.ligo.caltech.edu/~jzweizig/distribution/LSC_Data/).

## Virgo

The Virgo sensitivity curves are taken from [here](http://www.virgo-gw.eu/DataAnalysis/Calibration/Sensitivity/)

## GEO600

The GEO600 sensitivity curves (held in [this](GEOallruns.txt) file for S1-S5 and in [this](S6) directory for S6) are taken from [here](http://www.geo600.org/1032083/GEO600_Sensitivity_Curves).

## Miscellaneous

The script [plotruntimes.py](plotruntimes.py) generates a plot of the timeline of the initial detector era.

The Einstein Telescope ([ET-D](ET_D_data.txt)) senstivity curve is taken from [here](http://www.et-gw.eu/etsensitivities) and is defined in  [S. Hild _et al._, Classical and Quantum Gravity, Volume 28, 094013, 2011](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/28/9/094013/meta).

The LCGT [curve](lcgt.txt) is taken from [K. Arai _et al._, Classical and Quantum Gravity, Volume 26, 204020, 2009](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/26/20/204020/meta).
